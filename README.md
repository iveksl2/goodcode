This repository contains Universal principles to improve code quality.  Although our 
strongly held opinions are never wrong, we will include principles that are emprically supported.
We do not intend on endorsing the software industries trendy new acronym or management theory. 
Much of the content draws upon principles & philosophy within [Making Software](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596808303.do) book.

Few Words of Caution:
No one principle is likely to be earth shattering in improving your code quality. However, similar to a trading strategy,
the accumulation of many small principles independently verified can in 
aggregate make a significant positive difference. 

Finally, we believe by far the single best way to improve you coding ability is to be in the trenches 
reading and writing code. This repository can serve serve as a post-mortem to allow
you to 'sharpen the saw' when attacking your next project.

Each Principle will Provide Empirical Support (i) and Reference / Documentation (ii) on learning & implementing the principle. 
# Principles:
  
- **Readability**
  1. ["What is good code?: A scientific definition](http://engineering.intenthq.com/2015/03/what-is-good-code-a-scientific-definition/) 
  2. ["How Do You Write Readable Code?: 11 Principles](https://gist.github.com/peterhurford/3ad9f48071bd2665a8af) 


- **Design Patterns**
  1. i.  Merely documenting presence of design patterns may reduce implementation time & improve program specification correctness.[1]   
     ii. Weak but significant evidence exists certain patterns reduce errors in pattern relavant maintenance tasks. [2] TODO: Include value added vs not patterns
     iii. Design Patterns allow for better / more distributed communication among the team when members share pattern knowledge. [3]

  2. Design patterns universally aren't  magic pill, the following design patterns within the FILLIN study were shown to add value. Provided are the links to implementation
