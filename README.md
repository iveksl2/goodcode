This repository contains Universal principles to improve code quality.  Although our 
strongly held opinions are never wrong, we will include principles that are emprically supported.
We do not intend on endorsing the software industries trendy new acronym or management theory. 
Much of the content draws upon principles & philosophy within [Making Software](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596808303.do) book.

Few Words of Caution:
No one principle is likely to be earth shattering in improving your code quality. However, 
the accumulation of a large set of principles independently verified can in 
aggregate make a significant positive difference. 

Finally, we believe by far the single best way to improve you coding ability is to be in the trenches 
reading and writing code. This repository can serve as a meta layer post-mortem to allow
you to 'sharpen the saw' when attacking your next project.
